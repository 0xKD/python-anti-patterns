:fa:`lock` Security
===================

Python is a highly dynamic language that gives the programmer many ways to change the runtime
behavior of his code and even dynamically execute new code. This is powerful but can be a security
risk as well.

Use the following patterns to increase the security of your code. 

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    Use of exec <use_of_exec>
    Use of eval <use_of_eval>

    Unsafe variables <use_of_unsafe_variable>
