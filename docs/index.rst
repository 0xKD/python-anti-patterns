:github_badge:`quantifiedcode/python-code-patterns`

Welcome, fellow Pythoneer! This is an open collection of Python  **code anti-patterns**. The goal of
this document is to show you how *NOT* to do things. In each document shown below, you will find an
example of badly written or problematic Python code, together with an easy-to-understand explanation
of the issues found in the code, and a proposed solution.

Many of the issues that we discuss here can be detected automatically using code analysis, e.g. using
Pylint, PyChecker or PEP8. You can also check many of these pattern online on our wrbsite, QuantifiedCode.
